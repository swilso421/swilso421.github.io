				<h2>What is coding club?</h2>
				<p>Coding club (also known as computer science club) is an after school program for students at HHS. It's run by Sam Wilson who took over in 2013 from Marc Cuva.
				At coding club, Sam teaches different programming languages and attempts to give insight into the processes that make computers go. This year, coding club will be
				held on Wednesdays from 2:45 to 3:30.</p>
				<h2>What will I learn at coding club?</h2>
				<p>In the past we have covered languages such as Scratch, Java, and Lua. At some point, articles and tutorials for these will be placed on this website. If you
				want to look at Scratch you can head over to the <a href="helpful-links.html">helpful links</a> page. This year we will be learning the basics of website design including
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tutorials and video lessons of what we have learned will be added to the site as we cover them. If you want some more information, jump down
				to the introductions on <a href="#html-intro">HTML</a>, <a href="#css-intro">CSS</a>, <a href="#js-intro">JavaScript</a>.</p>
				<h2>Introduction to HTML<a id="html-intro"></a></h2>
				<p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is the primary language used to make webpages across the internet. The basis of HTML are <i>tags</i>
				which tell a browser how to format text or another element. These tags list every element into a sort of hierarchy, and with the help of <a href="#css-intro">CSS</a>,
				add styles and attributes. The other fundamental part of HTML are <i>links</i>, which add the "hyper" to "hypertext". Links allow webpages, essentially text documents,
				to interact with each other in a basic manner.</p>
				<h2>Introduction to CSS<a id="css-intro"></a></h2>
				<p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It adds nearly all of the styling to a webpage. Without it, webpages would look more like text documents
				than presentations. The name comes from how the style attributes are passed along between elements. Using the hierarchy outlined in the HTML, CSS can pass style
				attributes down from parent elements to child elements (hence, "cascading"). The "style sheets" part comes from the abilty to store these style rules in separate
				documents that are loaded by the HTML files.</p>
				<h2>Introduction to JavaScript<a id="js-intro"></a></h2>
				<p>JavaScript, despite its name, has almost nothing to do with Java. JavaScript is what most web developers use to add functionality to their webpages. While HTML and
				CSS are markup languages, JavaScript is a full-fledged interpreted language. This means you can make actual programs which interact and affect the elements on a webpage.
				Pretty much everything you do on a website from logging in to searching for products uses at least some JavaScript to give that functionality.</p>
